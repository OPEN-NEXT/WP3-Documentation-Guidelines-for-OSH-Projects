# 3D Printing Guidelines

Design considerations

* Wall thickness (shelling)
* Wall thickness for bottom and top
* Design for support
* File resolution
* Clearances
* Shrinkage/ retractation
* Filling (Density and type)
* Embossed and engraved details
* Holes
* Fillets
* Threads

Settings considerations

* Extruder setting -- Extrusion multiplier -- Retraction distance -- Retraction speed -- Coasting
* Layer setting -- First layer height -- First layer speed
* Laver height
* Printing bed temperature
* Infill setting -- Internal/Eternal fill pattern
* Temperature setting
* Cooling setting
